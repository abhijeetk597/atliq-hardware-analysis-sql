**ðŸ”Ž Bussiness Insights:**

1. For every fiscal year, the total sold quantity is growing more than double of its previous year which is very good sign and depicts the business expansion.
2. In 2022, we observe decline in sold qty but, we have data upto december only which is 4th month of 2022 fiscal year and still 8 more months to go and we can expect very high total sales. 

### Task 2: Query the quarters of 2021 by sold quantity and plot line graph

```python
# querying the quarters by sold quantity
query = """
    SELECT
       *,
       get_fiscal_quarter(s.date) as quarter         
    FROM fact_sales_monthly s
    WHERE fiscal_year = 2021
"""

df_quaterly_sales = pd.read_sql_query(text(query), conn)
df_quaterly_sales.head(2)
```
> |-|	date	|fiscal_year	|product_code	|customer_code	|sold_quantity	|quarter|
> |-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
> |0	|2020-09-01	|2021	|A0118150101	|70002017	|248	|Q1|
> |1	|2020-09-01	|2021	|A0118150101	|70002018	|240|	Q1|

```python
# Now let's groupby by quarter and convert to million
q = pd.DataFrame(round(df_quaterly_sales.groupby("quarter")["sold_quantity"].sum()/1000000, 2))
q
```
> |quarter| sold_quantity|
> |-|-|
> |Q1|14.48|
> |Q2|13.81|
> |Q3|10.98|
> |Q4|10.89|

```python
# Plot sold_quantity on line graph
q.plot(kind="line", y="sold_quantity", title="2021: Total Sold Quantity(mln)-Quarterly");
```
> ![sold_qty_line_graph](sold_qty_quarterly.png)

**ðŸ”Ž Bussiness Insights:**

- From the above, we can see that **Q1** has the highest total sales followed by Q2.
- Through investigation, it is found that Quarter1 and Quarter2 has major events across the world like Christmas, Dhussera, Diwali etc which are helping to generate more sales and revenue to Atliq company.
- So, like every fiscal year, need to be more attention in these Quarters and have very good back-up of the products in Warehouses.

### Task 3: Generate a report with Top 5 products in each division by sold quantity

```python
# call a stored procedure
df_top_products = pd.read_sql_query(
    text("call gdb0041.get_top_n_products_per_division_by_qty_sold(2021, 5);"), conn
)

df_top_products

### Task 4: Which channel brings more gross sales in the year 2021 and plot the pie chart

```python
# query channelwise gross sales
query = """
    WITH channel_gross_sales AS
    (
        SELECT 
            c.channel AS channel,

        FROM

                gdb0041.dim_customer c USING (customer_code)

                s.fiscal_year = 2021
        GROUP BY channel
    )
    
    SELECT
        channel,
        gross_sales_mln,
        ROUND(100 * gross_sales_mln / SUM(gross_sales_mln) OVER (),
                2
              ) AS percentage

> |1	|Direct|	257.53|	15.47|
> |2	|Distributor|	188.03|	11.30|

```python
# Create a Pie chart for channel-wise gross sales
plt.style.use("default")
x = pd.Series(list(df_channel_gross.gross_sales_mln), index=df_channel_gross.channel)
x.plot(kind="pie", autopct="%.2f%%", title="Channel-wise contribution in Gross sales");
```
> ![channel_gross_sales](channel_gross_sales.png)

**ðŸ”Ž Bussiness Insights:**

- In 2021, Retailers contribute nearly 73% of total gross_sales amount.
- We can give good pre-invoice deductions(discounts) on products for top performing retailers and that have a scope to maintain good relationships with them and thus have a scope to increase more gross sales.
- We need to think why **Direct(Atliq Stores)** are failing to perform same as retailers and do through study of sucess measures of retailers and try to implement for our stores
